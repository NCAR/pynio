# PyNIO

PyNIO ("pie-nee-oh") is a Python module that allows read and/or write access to a variety of scientific data formats popular in climate and weather:

 * NetCDF3 / NetCDF4
 * GRIB1 / GRIB2
 * HDF4 
 * HDF-EOS2
 * HDF-EOS5
 * Shapefile

PyNIO has a data model interface that is modeled on the [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) data model.

PyNIO is developed by the [Computational and Information Systems Lab](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu), and is funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov).

# Installation

PyNIO can be installed on Linux and MacOS systems via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/):

```
conda create --name pyn_env --channel conda-forge pynio
source activate pyn_env
```
