access to a variety of scientific data formats (NetCDF 3/4, GRIB1,
GRIB2, HDF4, HDF-EOS2, HDF-EOS5, shapefile, CCM History tape) using an
interface modelled on NetCDF.

Installation:
-------------

Required: Python 2.4 or higher and NumPy version 1.0 or higher.  For
this version, we used Python 2.6.2 and NumPy 1.3.0.  Earlier or later
versions of these packages may work, but we haven't tested all of
them.

Binary installation is simple:

    python setup.py install

This command may require root privileges on some systems.

Source code installation is not trivial. See the INSTALL file
in this directory.

Examples:
---------

There are some PyNIO examples in the "test" directory.

If you also have PyNGL installed, then you can type:

   pynglex nio01 nio02
